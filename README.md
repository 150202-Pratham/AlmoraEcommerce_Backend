**Building a Production-Ready Scalable Commerce Backend with Modern Backend Engineering Principles**

</div>

---

# 📖 Overview

**Almora** is a modern fashion-focused e-commerce platform built to explore **real-world backend engineering practices** instead of just implementing CRUD operations.

The project is evolving from a traditional Spring Boot application into a **production-grade scalable commerce platform** by gradually introducing industry-standard backend concepts such as:

- Performance Optimization
- Dynamic Query Engine
- Redis Caching
- Object Storage (MinIO)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- RabbitMQ
- Docker
- Horizontal Scaling
- Nginx Load Balancing
- Production Deployment

This repository documents not only the implementation but also the **engineering decisions** behind every architectural improvement.

---

# 🎯 Vision

The objective of Almora is **not** to clone Amazon or Flipkart.

Instead, the goal is to understand:

- How production systems evolve
- Why architectural decisions matter
- How scalability is introduced incrementally
- How backend systems are designed for millions of users

Every feature added to Almora solves a **real engineering problem** rather than simply introducing a new technology.
